Picodi
======

Picodi simplifies Dependency Injection (DI) for Python applications.

`DI <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection>`_ is a design pattern
that allows objects to receive their dependencies from
an external source rather than creating them internally.

This library supports both synchronous and asynchronous contexts,
and offers features like scopes and lifecycle management.

Picodi is inspired by FastAPI's dependency injection system, but it's
a standalone library that can be used in any Python application.
